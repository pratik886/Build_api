# Build_api
This assignment involves building a secure, efficient RESTful API to manage a collection of webtoons. It includes CRUD operations (create, read, delete) using a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL. The API features JWT authentication for security, input validation, and rate-limiting for performance optimization and protection against abuse.
